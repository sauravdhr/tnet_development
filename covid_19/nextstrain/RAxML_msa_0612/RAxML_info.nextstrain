sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file /data/tnet_development/covid_19/nextstrain/msa_0612.align.reduced


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs" 


Alignment has 144 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data



This is RAxML version 8.2.12 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on May 2018.

RAxML rapid bootstrapping and subsequent ML search

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization



Executing 10 rapid bootstrap inferences and thereafter a thorough ML search 

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
