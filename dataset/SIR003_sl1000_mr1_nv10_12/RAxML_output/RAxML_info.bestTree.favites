RAxML tree rooting algorithm


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC -f I -m GTRGAMMA -t dataset/SIR003_sl1000_mr1_nv10_12/RAxML_output/RAxML_bestTree.favites -n bestTree.favites -w /data/FAVITES_compare_TNet_v2/dataset/SIR003_sl1000_mr1_nv10_12/RAxML_output 


RAxML-rooted tree using subtree length-balance printed to file:
/data/FAVITES_compare_TNet_v2/dataset/SIR003_sl1000_mr1_nv10_12/RAxML_output/RAxML_rootedTree.bestTree.favites


Time for tree rooting: 0.039042
